## Spatial Grid System Uses

1. **Efficient Collision Detection**
    - Use the grid for detecting collisions with entities like enemies, traps, or items.

2. **Pathfinding Algorithms**
    - Implement algorithms like A* or Dijkstra for NPC movement using the grid.

3. **Procedural Generation Enhancements**
    - Refine dungeon generation for balanced distribution and avoiding inaccessible areas.

4. **Area of Effect (AoE) Calculations**
    - Calculate effects of spells or explosions efficiently within the grid.

5. **Fog of War and Exploration**
    - Manage a fog of war feature, where the map is hidden until explored.

6. **Dynamic Environment Changes**
    - Implement changes like opening doors, activating traps, or changing room layouts.

7. **Resource Management**
    - Track resource locations, quantities, and depletion using the grid.

8. **Lighting and Sound Effects**
    - Calculate lighting effects and sound propagation.

9. **Optimized Rendering**
    - Render only parts of the dungeon in or near the player's view.

10. **Layered Grids for Multi-Level Dungeons**
    - Manage multiple dungeon levels with a layered grid system.
